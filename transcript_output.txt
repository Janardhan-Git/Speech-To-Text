[0:00:00 - 0:00:10] Candidate: and closed security.
[0:00:00 - 0:00:10] Candidate: So there I worked on one release management and this does occur
[0:00:10 - 0:00:24] Candidate: like checking code, quality code and using Sonal Cloud and CC using Black
[0:00:24 - 0:00:31] Candidate: Cloud and testing using birthsute etc.
[0:00:24 - 0:00:31] Candidate: Before that I worked with Tata
[0:00:31 - 0:00:39] Candidate: Lexi.
[0:00:31 - 0:00:39] Candidate: There it's both Cloud security and GDPR and CCS.
[0:00:31 - 0:00:39] Candidate: So I assist
[0:00:39 - 0:00:45] Candidate: on internal learning and I also work for Cloud security role.
[0:00:39 - 0:00:45] Candidate: Before that I worked
[0:00:45 - 0:00:52] Candidate: with the Pro.
[0:00:45 - 0:00:52] Candidate: There it's a network security and in-point security kind of role.
[0:00:52 - 0:00:58] Candidate: Two choice there I worked with the checkpoint firewall and 10 microdibs security and
[0:00:58 - 0:01:09] Candidate: various SO4s etc.
[0:00:58 - 0:01:09] Candidate: This is my experience in cyber security and little with AML.
[0:01:09 - 0:01:15] Candidate: Before that whatever I have is a general light like Sonal and Supportly.
[0:01:16 - 0:01:25] Candidate: Okay, general we are looking out for AI and MM.
[0:01:16 - 0:01:25] Candidate: So can you rate yourself for AI and
[0:01:25 - 0:01:30] Candidate: ML so that I it's easier for me to ask the questions.
[0:01:30 - 0:01:39] Candidate: Yeah, AML till October I worked only I have very less experience with AML and Pita.
[0:01:40 - 0:01:47] Candidate: After that because prior to was not there I was to this what I call gig activities
[0:01:47 - 0:01:55] Candidate: like it's not project but it's like we can say it's like Timbra dummy project
[0:01:55 - 0:02:00] Candidate: like that.
[0:01:55 - 0:02:00] Candidate: So there I worked on different AI activities like
[0:02:01 - 0:02:13] Candidate: the CCS has some tools.
[0:02:01 - 0:02:13] Candidate: So for enhancing those tools I I assisted in internal
[0:02:13 - 0:02:21] Candidate: and internal network pages like that.
[0:02:13 - 0:02:21] Candidate: For support I have to decide that.
[0:02:22 - 0:02:28] Interviewer: Can you explain I mean I didn't find how can you rate yourself.
[0:02:28 - 0:02:32] Candidate: Okay, honest scale of 10.
[0:02:32 - 0:02:40] Candidate: 10 AML I can rate of 5 and Pita now 6.5.
[0:02:40 - 0:02:44] Candidate: And I am not machine learning.
[0:02:44 - 0:02:46] Candidate: Yeah, 5.
[0:02:46 - 0:02:48] Candidate: Okay.
[0:02:49 - 0:02:52] Interviewer: Can you explain what is machine learning?
[0:02:52 - 0:02:59] Candidate: Yeah, machine learning is part of an artificial intelligence and machine learning is
[0:02:59 - 0:03:06] Candidate: easier for training particular models where it's easier for automation again
[0:03:06 - 0:03:14] Candidate: and that is like dynamic we can train the easy different models and we can achieve
[0:03:14 - 0:03:18] Candidate: the nature of desired result.
[0:03:18 - 0:03:26] Candidate: If we take some computer with an object detection like that we can have we can
[0:03:26 - 0:03:32] Candidate: we can we can we can train on particular some scale.
[0:03:32 - 0:03:40] Candidate: Facility scaffolder some other models and we can compare accuracy and how they are.
[0:03:40 - 0:03:44] Interviewer: How much they are taking for work?
[0:03:44 - 0:03:53] Interviewer: Can you explain what's neural network neural networks it's.
[0:03:53 - 0:04:05] Candidate: We can see it's like a human intelligence it's a two what we call.
[0:04:05 - 0:04:15] Candidate: Those are reason in high applications neural networks it's.
[0:04:15 - 0:04:30] Candidate: It's it's a it's a it's a it's a human intelligence brain.
[0:04:30 - 0:04:35] Candidate: It has a deeper learning algorithms and.
[0:04:35 - 0:04:37] Interviewer: What is it?
[0:04:37 - 0:04:38] Candidate: Learning.
[0:04:38 - 0:04:42] Interviewer: How to expand.
[0:04:42 - 0:04:55] Candidate: Neural networks it is is in high end applications and it needs a lot of GPUs and resources to run those applications.
[0:04:55 - 0:05:03] Candidate: It has a deeper learning network.
[0:05:03 - 0:05:10] Interviewer: What is that deeper learning?
[0:05:10 - 0:05:19] Interviewer: What is the difference between deep learning and ML machine learning?
[0:05:19 - 0:05:29] Candidate: It's a deep learning is part of ML and.
[0:05:29 - 0:05:39] Candidate: Again it's a deep learning is easy or it is helpful where a human like.
[0:05:39 - 0:05:41] Interviewer: So what is the back propagation?
[0:05:41 - 0:05:43] Candidate: Back propagation.
[0:05:43 - 0:05:46] Candidate: I'm not sure.
[0:05:46 - 0:05:56] Interviewer: So what is the loss function?
[0:05:56 - 0:06:04] Candidate: I think.
[0:06:04 - 0:06:07] Interviewer: Why do I know?
[0:06:07 - 0:06:09] Candidate: I know exactly but I don't.
[0:06:10 - 0:06:13] Candidate: I'm getting getting.
[0:06:13 - 0:06:19] Candidate: I think it's a vent training what is the accuracy and.
[0:06:19 - 0:06:24] Candidate: In accuracy I think that is loss of function.
[0:06:24 - 0:06:27] Candidate: That is a loss function.
[0:06:27 - 0:06:30] Candidate: I'm not sure how to see.
[0:06:30 - 0:06:33] Candidate: Well I'm asking what is a loss function.
[0:06:33 - 0:06:39] Candidate: If you don't know you can say don't know.
[0:06:39 - 0:06:43] Candidate: It's a loss function or a loss function.
[0:06:43 - 0:06:47] Candidate: I'm not sure.
[0:06:47 - 0:06:51] Candidate: If you say don't know.
[0:06:51 - 0:06:53] Candidate: Honest.
[0:06:53 - 0:06:55] Candidate: I appreciate.
[0:06:55 - 0:06:59] Candidate: You said you don't know what is back propagation.
[0:06:59 - 0:07:09] Interviewer: What is actually a model?
[0:07:09 - 0:07:10] Candidate: Yeah.
[0:07:10 - 0:07:14] Candidate: Model is.
[0:07:14 - 0:07:17] Candidate: It's like what I call.
[0:07:17 - 0:07:24] Candidate: I'm not able to tell but I tell as much as is English.
[0:07:24 - 0:07:28] Candidate: Model are used to train the data.
[0:07:28 - 0:07:30] Candidate: There can be different models.
[0:07:30 - 0:07:36] Candidate: A developer by different providers like OpenAI or Meta or Google.
[0:07:36 - 0:07:43] Candidate: So they train and pre-defined data sets and they will release for public.
[0:07:43 - 0:07:45] Candidate: They make it private.
[0:07:45 - 0:07:51] Candidate: So others can use those models for training their own data.
[0:07:51 - 0:07:57] Candidate: To make their own AI products.
[0:07:57 - 0:08:01] Candidate: So model is AI data.
[0:08:01 - 0:08:09] Candidate: Model is a set of.
[0:08:09 - 0:08:19] Candidate: Set of.
[0:08:19 - 0:08:29] Candidate: It's a set of.
[0:08:29 - 0:08:34] Candidate: It's a set of.
[0:08:34 - 0:08:50] Candidate: There is to train a particular data like financial data or healthcare.
[0:08:50 - 0:08:52] Candidate: So where exactly.
[0:08:52 - 0:09:01] Candidate: At a machine will be the neural networks.
[0:09:01 - 0:09:11] Candidate: It can be easier in your sector.
[0:09:11 - 0:09:17] Candidate: Where are the end applications and automation required.
[0:09:17 - 0:09:23] Candidate: It must be easier in healthcare and in my name.
[0:09:23 - 0:09:38] Candidate: And research.
[0:09:38 - 0:09:43] Candidate: These sectors.
[0:09:43 - 0:09:48] Candidate: Can be mostly in these sectors.
[0:09:48 - 0:09:54] Interviewer: So what do you mean by a class in Python?
[0:09:54 - 0:10:03] Candidate: Class is inheritable and it has objects inside it.
[0:10:03 - 0:10:07] Interviewer: What is the difference between class and a function?
[0:10:08 - 0:10:15] Candidate: Or blocks of code where we can define to.
[0:10:15 - 0:10:19] Candidate: To.
[0:10:27 - 0:10:29] Candidate: That can be defined using the.
[0:10:29 - 0:10:30] Candidate: Def.
[0:10:31 - 0:10:38] Candidate: And we can write function and it it it can be used as where in the code.
[0:10:38 - 0:10:40] Candidate: Reasonable blocks.
[0:10:40 - 0:10:44] Candidate: The notice a class.
[0:10:44 - 0:10:49] Candidate: Class is set of objects and.
[0:10:49 - 0:10:52] Candidate: So then what is the difference between class and object.
[0:10:52 - 0:10:55] Candidate: Class and function.
[0:11:01 - 0:11:03] Candidate: I read those.
[0:11:03 - 0:11:04] Candidate: I.
[0:11:04 - 0:11:06] Candidate: For that actually.
[0:11:06 - 0:11:07] Candidate: Sorry.
[0:11:07 - 0:11:08] Candidate: I'll.
[0:11:08 - 0:11:09] Candidate: I read those.
[0:11:09 - 0:11:10] Candidate: Uh.
[0:11:10 - 0:11:11] Candidate: Three.
[0:11:11 - 0:11:12] Candidate: Yeah.
[0:11:12 - 0:11:13] Candidate: Yeah.
[0:11:13 - 0:11:15] Candidate: Okay.
[0:11:15 - 0:11:18] Interviewer: Do you know what are pointers and structures.
[0:11:18 - 0:11:20] Candidate: Yeah.
[0:11:20 - 0:11:21] Candidate: Yeah.
[0:11:21 - 0:11:24] Candidate: Pointer pointers.
[0:11:25 - 0:11:27] Candidate: Uh.
[0:11:27 - 0:11:36] Candidate: Suppose if we input from from particular libraries.
[0:11:36 - 0:11:38] Candidate: Those can be.
[0:11:38 - 0:11:39] Candidate: Uh.
[0:11:39 - 0:11:40] Candidate: Use it to.
[0:11:40 - 0:11:58] Candidate: To point of what to go library.
[0:11:58 - 0:12:00] Interviewer: What is imported level later.
[0:12:00 - 0:12:01] Candidate: So it's a structure.
[0:12:01 - 0:12:12] Candidate: It's like a race and.
[0:12:12 - 0:12:13] Candidate: Stacks.
[0:12:13 - 0:12:14] Candidate: Stacks.
[0:12:14 - 0:12:16] Candidate: Tens are.
[0:12:16 - 0:12:19] Candidate: Tens are flow.
[0:12:19 - 0:12:21] Candidate: Or yeah.
[0:12:21 - 0:12:27] Candidate: Tens flow is developed by Google and it is for public use.
[0:12:28 - 0:12:29] Candidate: It is for.
[0:12:29 - 0:12:31] Candidate: Is it is one of the libraries.
[0:12:31 - 0:12:33] Candidate: Like a circuit.
[0:12:33 - 0:12:35] Candidate: Lerent and sort of flow like that.
[0:12:35 - 0:12:37] Candidate: Uh.
[0:12:41 - 0:12:42] Candidate: I forgot.
[0:12:42 - 0:12:43] Candidate: I forgot.
[0:12:43 - 0:12:44] Candidate: Uh.
[0:12:44 - 0:12:45] Candidate: I forgot.
[0:12:45 - 0:12:46] Candidate: Okay.
